# how the game works
## both players start at spot 1
## Players will click on the di and automatically move forward that many spaces they rolled
##    - If player lands on a snake head, player moves down
##    - If player lands on a ladder, player moves up
##    - If player rolls a number higher than spots move they should move back. Ex. player is in spot 98 and rolled a 3...they end up at spot 99
## Click on move to next player so next player can roll the di
## Keep repeating until a player lands on spot 100
## Ask if they want to play again
